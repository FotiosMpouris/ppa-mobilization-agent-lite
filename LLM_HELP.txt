I am trying to run a local Python application called the "PPA Mobilization Agent." I am not a professional developer, so please explain things simply.

Here is the technical context of the application:
1. It is a Python script running on my local machine.
2. It uses 'streamlit' for the user interface.
3. It uses 'openai' for generating text.
4. It uses 'nostr-sdk' to post to decentralized social media.
5. It uses a virtual environment (venv).

I am currently stuck. Here is the error message or issue I am facing:

Please tell me the exact command to type into my terminal to fix this.
Provide your instructions in the most basic and easy to follow manner possible. You should not take anything for granted in terms of what you think I do or don't know. You should provide a very easy to understand explanation of what is happening.
You should also ask any question that you need answers to, and with more easy to follow instructions, I will attempt to find answer to these questions so that you can help me solve this issue.
